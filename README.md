## Introduction  

This project explores personal health data collected through the **Samsung Health app**, focusing mainly on **sleep patterns** and **heart rate trends**.  
The goal is to understand how daily habits, sleep quality, and heart activity vary over time, and what patterns can be drawn from them.  

The dataset was exported from a personal device and analyzed to uncover meaningful insights into lifestyle and well-being.  
**Python** (for exploration and visualization) were used in the workflow.

## Sleep Analysis  

Sleep plays a crucial role in recovery and daily performance. The dataset was studied to examine:  
- **General sleeping patterns**: showing overall distribution of sleep duration.  
- **Disrupted sleep**: identifying nights with interruptions and how they impact total rest.  
- **Daytime waking habits**: highlighting waking hours between 10am and 7pm to see when most wake-ups occurred.  

From the findings, disrupted nights tended to shorten total sleep duration, while consistent waking times aligned with healthier overall rest patterns.

## Heart Rate Analysis  

Heart rate was examined across multiple perspectives to capture both long-term and daily patterns:  
- **Daily averages over months**: with weekly and monthly rolling averages showing gradual fluctuations.  
- **Hourly variations**: identifying how heart rate behaves throughout the day, with noticeable peaks and dips.  
- **Distribution analysis**: showing the common resting heart rate range.  
- **Hourly boxplots**: visualizing spread and outliers in different times of the day.  

These insights help paint a clearer picture of how activity, rest, and lifestyle affect overall heart health.

## Key Insights  

- Disrupted sleep reduces total sleep duration and affects consistency.  
- Most wake-ups fall between **10am â€“ 7pm**, reflecting regular daytime patterns.  
- Heart rate shows a steady rhythm but also varies significantly by time of day.  
- Rolling averages reveal gradual shifts that might not be visible in daily data alone.

## Conclusion  

This project shows how personal health data can be transformed into meaningful insights with simple analysis.  
By combining **sleep** and **heart rate trends**, it becomes easier to identify lifestyle patterns that contribute to better rest and overall wellness.  

While the study is based on one individualâ€™s data, the same approach can be applied more broadly to monitor and improve personal health over time.
